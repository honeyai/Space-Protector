# Space Protector
___
## Space battle Console game
___

You are on a return path home to Earth, when you're sidelined by a fleet of alien ships. Before you can continue home you must defeat them all. 

Fortunately for you the aliens only attack one by one before they send in the next. Will they go down one by one or will you fall before you can return home?

___
### Getting Started
___
The player will be asked which choice to make. The player will always attack first. If they attack and don't miss, the alien will take it's damage, if the alien still stands it makes it's attack. The player will take damage if the alien hits. 

Once the current alien ship is downed, the next appears and then the player will be asked if they want to attack or retreat. 

At retreat, there will be a confirmation which will either take you back to the game or a game over sequence, then the option to play again.
